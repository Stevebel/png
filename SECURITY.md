## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe to have found a vulnerability that **could be used for 
malicious purposes** please [Open a draft Security Advisory](https://github.com/Stevebel/png/security/advisories/new).
This allows the maintainers a chance to review and make emergancy fixes
before publishing the advisory to the public. We will make every effort to take care of the vulnerability as soon as we are aware.
If the vulnerability can't easily be patched in a few days, we will publish the advisory with suggested actions for users of the library.

If you are aware of an issue that could lead to future vulnerabilities, or a vulnerable dependency not caught by Dependabot,
please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Stevebel/png/issues). Issues will be considered on a case-by-case basis and may take weeks to answer.
